I spearheaded the development of an innovative online food delivery web application, integrating cutting-edge technologies to enhance user experience and operational efficiency. Utilizing Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and HTMX, I designed and developed a seamless UI for the platform. Additionally, I implemented an AI-powered chatbot using Botpress and OpenAI API to provide customers with personalized order assistance and recommendations. Furthermore, I optimized database management with SQL to efficiently handle user orders, restaurant listings, and real-time tracking.
